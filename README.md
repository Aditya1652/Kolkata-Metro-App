# Kolkata-Metro-Map

In this project, I have implemented Dijkstra's algorithm in Java to determine the shortest path between two stations represented as nodes in a graph. The purpose of this algorithm is to efficiently calculate the minimum cost or distance required to travel from a source station to a destination station.
